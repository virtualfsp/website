# vFSP Privacy Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to describe how vFSP collects, uses, and shares personal information.

## Applicability

This policy applies to any current or former user of vFSP who has authenticated with vFSP using a VATSIM Certificate Identification (CID) number via VATSIM Connect.

## Policy

### 1. Registration

Use of vFSP does not require registration with vFSP services. Users must have registered with, and provide, a VATSIM CID to authenticate with vFSP. VATSIM maintains its own Privacy Policy which can be found on its website.

### 2. Information Collection and Use

vFSP may collect information provided by VATSIM, including but not limited to, usersâ€™ CIDs and names, for users that authenticate with vFSP. vFSP will not share, sell or rent this information to other parties. vFSP users have a right to:

- A right to be informed about why we collect your data. This policy explains these reasons to you.
- A right to access your data and view the data collected on you. This data will be released to you on written request.
- A right to rectify data you believe to be inaccurate.
- The right to request your personal data be erased from the vFSP systems.
- The right to object to our legitimate interests. While your objection is being considered, processing of your data may be frozen, and this may restrict your ability to authenticate via vFSP.

### 3. Personal Statistical Information and Logging

In the normal course of authenticating with vFSP via VATSIM Connect, certain personal statistical information may be collected. This information includes, but is not limited to, name, CID and time of connection. This information will not be shared publicly or with 3rd parties, but statistical information may be aggregated and shared in an anonymized manner.
