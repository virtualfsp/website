# vFSP Privacy Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to describe how vFSP collects, uses, and shares personal information.

## Applicability

This policy applies to any current or former user of vFSP who has authenticated with vFSP using a VATSIM Certificate Identification (CID) number via VATSIM Connect.

## Policy

### 1. Registration

Use of vFSP does not require registration with vFSP services. Users must have registered with, and provide, a VATSIM CID to authenticate with vFSP. VATSIM maintains its own Privacy Policy which can be found on its website.

### 2. Information Collection and Use

vFSP may collect information provided by VATSIM, including but not limited to, users’ CIDs and names, for users that authenticate with vFSP via VATSIM Connect. vFSP will not share, sell or rent this information to other parties.

In compliance with GDPR, we process data under the following lawful bases:
- **Consent**: when authenticating with vFSP via VATSIM Connect.
- **Contractual necessity**: to provide access to our services.
- **Legitimate interest**: for system integrity.
- **Legal obligation**: to comply with applicable requirements for VATSIM.

### 3. Your Privacy Rights (GDPR and CCPA)

Under GDPR and CCPA (California Residents), users of vFSP have the following rights:

- A right to be informed about why we collect your data. This policy explains these reasons to you.
- A right to access your data and view the data collected on you. This data will be released to you on written request.
- A right to rectify data you believe to be inaccurate.
- The right to request your personal data be erased from the vFSP systems.
- The right to object to our legitimate interests. While your objection is being considered, processing of your data may be frozen, and this may restrict your ability to authenticate via vFSP.

You can exercise any of these rights by contacting admin@vfsp.net.

### 4. Personal Statistical Information and Logging

In the normal course of authenticating with vFSP via VATSIM Connect, certain personal statistical information may be collected. This information includes, but is not limited to, name, CID and time of connection. This information will not be shared publicly or with 3rd parties, but statistical information may be aggregated and shared in an anonymized manner.

### 5. Data Retention

We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. Data related to user accounts, exams, logs, and support is retained for up to 24 months after inactivity unless required otherwise by law or upon user request.

### 6. International Data Transfers

Your data may be stored and processed in the United States, United Kingdom, or European Union. We apply appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to ensure lawful international data transfers under GDPR.


### 7. Children’s Privacy

Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Access requires a VATSIM account, which is restricted to individuals aged 13 or older. We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age.

If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us immediately at admin@vfsp.net to request deletion.

### 8. Cookies

vFSP may use cookies on its site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive which is used to track you through our site and for network security.

### 9. Links to External Websites and Services

The vFSP website contains links to third-party sites. vFSP is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such other sites. vFSP encourages its users to be aware when they leave its website and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.
